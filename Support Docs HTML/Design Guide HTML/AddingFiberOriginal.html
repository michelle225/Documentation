<li><strong>Thicker walls, further up the part, enable more fiber to be placed.</strong></li>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large">Reduce Plastic Walls to increase Fiber Fill</span></p>
<p>Having 2-3 plastic walls provides great surface finish on your parts. In many aerospace applications, we reduce walls to 1, which allows more room for fiber fill. It also puts the fiber further out in a given layer, increasing the cross-sectional moment of inertia, which increases strength to weight.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large">Recap about Fiber Printing</span></p>
<p>CFF is a new manufacturing process. Like any other manufacturing process, it has limitations. Please take into consideration the following variables when designing parts for CFF or editing layers with the Eiger:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum feature size:</strong> This means that not all areas of your part can be filled with fiber. The algorithms employed by Eiger to fill your part do their best to make sure that as much fiber will fit into your part as possible.</li>
<li><strong>The fiber has a integer width:</strong> This means the width must be accounted for when the fiber makes turns. There are some corners and turns that the fiber can't make. There are also some spaces (remainders) that cannot be filled with fiber. They will automatically be filled with nylon. </li>
<li><strong>The fiber cannot print over mid-air:</strong> For best fiber adhesion, fill the layers below with 100% plastic fill so the fibers have something to adhere to. In the <strong>Internal View</strong> you can change the plastic <strong>Fill Type</strong> of a layer to floor or roof to give it 100% fill.</li>
</ul>
