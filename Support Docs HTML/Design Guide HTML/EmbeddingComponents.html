	<p>Electronics and other components can be embedded inside your part.  </p>
	<p><strong>To embed a component inside a part during a print:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			Before Printing:
				<ul>
					<ol>
						<li>Model a cavity for the component and export the STL file.</li>
						<li>Open Eiger and import the STL file with the cavity</li>
						<li>Verify the print settings and save the part</li>
						<li>Click on <strong>"Internal View"</strong> near the bottom right of the screen.</li>
						<li>Click on <strong>"2D"</strong> near the top right of the screen.</li>
						<li>Use the layer bar at the bottom of the screen to select a layer to pause the print at. <br /><em>Note: The selected layer should be one in which the cavity is still open but is also deep enough to hold the component without causing a collision with the print head.</em></li>
						<li>With the layer selected, toggle the <strong>"Pause After Layer"</strong> button under the <strong>"Editing Layer"</strong> heading at the top right of the screen.</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
			<br />
			During the Print Process:
				<ul>
					<ol>
						<li>Start your print and wait for the printer to pause after the layer indicated.</li>
						<li>Use the supplied glue stick to apply glue to top and bottom of the component that will be embedded.</li>
						<li>Place the component into the cavity and ensure that it is firmly in pace.</li>
						<li>Ensure the component is below the print nozzle, when placed in the cavity, or the print nozzle may collide with the part and be damaged.</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
		</ul>
