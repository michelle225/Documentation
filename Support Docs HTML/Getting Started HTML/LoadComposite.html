<blockquote><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Important:</span></span>
<p class="wysiwyg-font-align-justify">The Fiber is spooled under tension. If you un-tape the fiber and let go the fiber will unspool itself and cannot be re-spooled by hand. Always pinch the fiber against the spool, and tape in place to prevent unwinding.<br /><br /> Do not press the <strong>"Cut"</strong> button until the fiber has exited the nozzle. Failure to do so will cause a fiber jam.</p>

<ol><!-- Step 1 -->
<li>Remove the fiber spool from its packaging.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 2 -->
<li>Lay the spool down on a flat surface.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 3 -->
<li>Gently grip the free end of the fiber with one hand to keep it from unspooling. Use the other hand to remove the small piece of tape securing the free end of the fiber. Set tape aside for later use.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 4 -->
<li>Gently unspool 2-3 feet of fiber.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201427009-myfacewhen.gif" alt="" width="429" height="322" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 5 -->
<li><strong>Re-secure the fiber to the side of the spool with the tape to prevent fiber from unspooling further.</strong><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 6 -->
<li>Place the fiber spool inside of the Mark Two, as shown below, and remove the spool holder cap.<br /><br /> <img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201426699-myfacewhen__1_.gif" alt="" width="432" height="324" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 7 -->
<li>Grip the free end of the fiber with one hand and the fiber inlet tube with the other. Thread the tip of the fiber into the tube and then hand feed it in until most of the unspooled fiber is in the tube. <br /><em>Note: Be careful not to kink or bend the fiber. If it breaks you will have to remove the broken fiber and start this step over.</em>  <br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201426689-myfacewhen__2_.gif" alt="" width="436" height="327" /> <br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 8 -->
<li>Place the spool onto the spool holder such that it unspools clockwise into the machine. Re-secure the spool holder cap.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201508675-myfacewhen__3_.gif" alt="" width="440" height="330" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 9 -->
<li>On the printer touchscreen, click the <strong>"Settings Icon"</strong> in the upper right-hand corner, and select <strong>“Load/Unload”</strong>, then <strong>“Load Fiber”</strong>. <br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 10 -->
<li>Once the spool is prepared, press <strong>"Continue"</strong> on the printer touch screen. <br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 11 -->
<li>When the fiber extruder starts moving, hand feed the fiber until it enters the back of the fiber extruder. <br /><em>Note: There is a slight lip on the inlet to the fiber extruder - if the fiber gets caught on this lip gently jiggle it until it get inside. Be careful not to use too much force or you will break or kink the fiber and have to start over. </em><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201509135-UnboxV1_720_fiber-insert_2.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 12 -->
<li>When the fiber is in the extruder, remove the tape that is securing the fiber to the spool so the extruder can unspool the fiber. Stick the tape back to the side of the spool for later use.<br /><em>Note: If the fiber is in the extruder correctly, you will feel a slight tug on the fiber. If you do not feel a tug on the fiber, the extruder likely does not have a grip on it. Repeat the above steps if the fiber is not inserted correctly.</em><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 13 -->
<li>When you have visual confirmation that the fiber has gone through the extruder and exited the other side, click <strong>"Next"</strong> on the screen.<br /><em>Note: If the fiber never exits out of the other side of the extruder, there may be a jam inside.</em><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201508655-myfacewhen__5_.gif" alt="" width="476" height="357" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 14 -->
<li>Wait as the fiber works its way through the fiber bowden tube and out the nozzle. After the fiber has exited the nozzle, press the <strong>"Cut"</strong> button.<br /><em><strong>Note: Do not press the cut button before the fiber has existed the nozzle or you will create a fiber jam. </strong>When you press the "Cut" button the machine will stop extruding and you will hear the cutter servo actuate. </em><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 15 -->
<li>Grip the fiber hanging from the nozzle with your hand and pull it from the machine, as shown below. <br /><em><strong>Note: You should pull out about a 2.5' segment of fiber.</strong> This is normal. The machine has just calibrated its fiber extrusion system. You may discard this strand of fiber.</em><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201426709-myfacewhen__6_.gif" alt="" width="479" height="359" /><br /><br /></li>
<!-- Step 16 -->
<li>Press <strong>“Done”</strong> on the printer touchscreen when finished.  Fiber is now loaded and ready to print.</li>
