	<ol>
		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<li>Push the orange fitting into the brass piece to unlock it</li>
		<!-- Step 2 -->

	<p>If you don't plan on using your Mark Two for an extended period of time, or you need to travel, move locations, or otherwise disconnect the dry box, make sure to USE THE PROVIDED RED PLUG TO SEAL THE DRY BOX. Failure to do so will damage your nylon and can lead to damaged parts if re-used.</p>
