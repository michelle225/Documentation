<p><strong>Use the supplied glue stick</strong> to apply a thin layer of glue to the print bed.  It's water-soluble kids glue. </p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>You can apply glue to the entire bed, or just where the part prints.</li>
<li>If you apply a thin layer of glue, you can apply it before each print.</li>
<li>If you notice glue buildup (an uneven, pitted looking surface) wash the residual glue from the bed with warm water and dry with a paper towel.</li>
<ul>
<li>The bed is waterproof.  You can fully submerge the bed, and wash it thoroughly.  Do not use a dishwasher. </li>
