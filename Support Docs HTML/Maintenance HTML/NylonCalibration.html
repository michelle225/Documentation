<!-- Nylon Extrusion Problem -->

<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Potential Nylon Extrusion Problem</strong></span></p>
<p>The purpose of this test is to determine how well the Nylon extrusion system is performing. The test extrudes a known amount of of Nylon. Based on the behavior of the machine during the test and the mass of this extrusion, you can determine if you're having extrusion problems. <br /><br /></p>
	<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Complete the following steps as directed.</p>
		<ol>
			<!-- Step 1 -->
			<li>Select <strong>"Calibration Extrude Test"</strong> from the <strong>"Utilities"</strong> menu on the screen of your printer.</li>
			<!-- Step 2 -->
			<li>Follow the prompts on the screen to begin the test.</li>
			<!-- Step 3 -->
			<li>Press <strong>"Continue"</strong> on the screen to continue the test when then nozzle reaches a high enough temperature.</li>
			<!-- Step 4 -->
			<li>Watch to ensure the printer extrudes nylon to purge the system. Make sure the printer retracts and pauses for two seconds after it finishes purging.</li>
			<!-- Step 5 -->
			<li>Remove the extruded nylon from the nozzle while the printer is paused.</li>
			<!-- Step 6 -->
			<li>As the nylon starts to extrude again, listen for clicking in the plastic extruder. If you notice clicking or the wheel jerking backwards, please see the sections below.</li>
			<!-- Step 7 -->
			<li>Use tweezers to catch the nylon that is extruded by the printer. This is the test sample that will be weighed.</li>
			<!-- Step 8 -->
			<li>When the printer finishes extruding, carefully collect all of the extruded nylon with the tweezers.</li>
			<!-- Step 9 -->
			<li>Weigh the second nylon flow on a balance that has at least 1mg accuracy. If the reading is less than 0.1800 grams, please see the sections below.

	<p> </p>
	<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> There are two possible signs of failure for this test.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Failure to extrude nylon or clicking of the extruder during the test can indicate that the nylon you are using has been exposed to water. Generally, in this case, the nylon is wet from extended exposure to air. This is generally caused by the dry box being opened for prolonged periods of time or not being closed properly.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>Underextrusion of the test part can indicate that the nylon is somewhat damp. The nylon can get damp even from simply sitting in the Nylon Bowden Tube for too long.</li>
		</ul>

	<p> </p>
	<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Solutions:</strong></span> Use dry nylon with your printer.
	<ul>
		<li>If you suspect that your nylon is more than slightly damp, you will have to replace the spool. In addition, check your dry box to ensure that it is able to seal properly. If your dry box cannot seal properly, consider investing in a new one. Avoid exposing the new nylon to air for more than 30 seconds at a time.<br /><br /></li>
		<li>If you suspect that your nylon is only slightly damp, try running the test part again two more times. If the weight of the test piece increases or falls between the range of 0.1800 g and 0.2100 g then your nylon is likely good to use.</li>
	</ul>
