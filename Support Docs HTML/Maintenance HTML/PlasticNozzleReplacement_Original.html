<ol>
<li>Push in the black Push-To-Connect fitting (circled in red below) to release the plastic nylon filament feed tube.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201980909/5.png" alt="" width="425" height="318" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Pull the plastic tube from the Push-To-Connect fitting to expose the nylon filament / material.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202036905/6.png" alt="" width="425" height="319" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using a pair of cutters, cut the nylon material.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202036925/7.png" alt="" width="425" height="319" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the LCD touch screen, select the menu in the upper right corner and select "Load / Unload Material".<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202543476/menu_main.jpeg" alt="" /></li>
<li>Select "Unload Nylon".<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202699853/menu_load_unload.jpeg" alt="" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>The nylon nozzle will heat up.  Once the heat up is complete, the “Next” button will appear - press "Next" to continue.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201981339/10.png" alt="" width="425" height="319" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>The printer will now purge the unused nylon filament from the system, by pushing it back out of the nylon extruder.  Take hold of the cut nylon material and help direct it free from the nylon extruder.  When it stops coming out, press “Stop” on the printer touch screen.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202037505/11.png" alt="" width="425" height="319" /><br /><br /><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202037495/12.png" alt="" width="425" height="319" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>With the print head still hot, unscrew the Nylon Bowden Tube Adapter from the print head.  Be careful - the print head assembly is still hot.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202350879/P1210472.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202391385/P1210474.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Look down into the nylon print head channel, and locate the small notched brass piece inside of the opening.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the provided flat head screwdriver, unscrew this piece until it is completely unthreaded.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202391445/P1210476.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202350909/P1210478.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the provided tweezers, grasp the brass piece (be careful - it is hot) and pull it up and out of the print head, along with the PTFE tube that is attached to it.  Allowing the print head to remain hot can allow for easier extraction of the PTFE tube.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202370809/P1210481_2.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202411205/P1210483_2.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Allow both the print head and brass piece to cool down below 40C.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Unscrew the old PTFE tube from the brass piece and discard it.  Sometimes this tube can be damaged or burned, as shown below.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202411195/P1210488_2.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Screw the brass piece into a new PTFE tube.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202350999/P1210490.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the provided 10mm nut driver, carefully unscrew and remove the Nylon nozzle.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202350969/P1210467.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202391525/P1210470.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the provided reamer tool, push the reamer through the top of the nylon print head channel until it comes out of the bottom of the print head.  Make certain that there are no obstructions and that the nylon path through the print head channel is clear.  If there is an obstruction (often the result of PTFE or solidified nylon residue), you may need to fully heat the nylon head via the Utilities menu and use the reamer tool to help remove any obstruction.  Once the obstruction is removed, let the print head cool down below 40C.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202351109/P1210496.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Look down into the nylon channel - you should see light at the bottom of the print head, indicating that it is free from obstruction.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Reinsert the new / replacement PTFE tube into the nylon print head channel.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202391745/P1210499.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br />If necessary, use the provided tweezers to help better guide it into the nylon print head channel.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202411305/P1210481.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the provided flat head screwdriver, screw the brass piece in until the top of it is flush with the bottom of the counter bore in the print head.  If it sits too high the bowden tube cannot fully seat from the top.  If it is screwed in too far it can buckle the PTFE tube in the nozzle.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202351409/P1210504.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Apply a small dot of the provided Anti-seize compound to the threads of the replacement nylon nozzle.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202411505/P1210512_3.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Thread the new nylon nozzle into the print head; screw it in to finger-tightness, unscrew it, then screw it back in to finger-tightness again; this will evenly distribute the applied Anti-Seize compound on the nozzle threads.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Using the 10mm nut driver, tighten the nozzle until it firmly bottoms out on the heater block.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202392115/P1210516.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Replace the Nylon Bowden Tube Adapter.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202411595/P1210519.png" alt="" width="425" height="283" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>Run the Load Nylon routine from the printer touch screen.</li>
