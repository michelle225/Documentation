<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Problem:</strong></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>My print stopped unexpectedly or printed a layer that was not in the right place.</li>
	</ul>

<!-- Dislocations -->
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Dislocations</strong></span></p>
	<p>Dislocations occur when the printhead collides with either the part or the printer causing the stepper motors to skip. This occasionally happens when a print is going poorly. If the print curls or warps such that the printhead or nozzles collide with it then it will likely lead to a dislocation. <br /><br />
	Dislocations are unrecoverable. The Mark Two is capable of detecting dislocations and will stop itself from wasting material or potentially damaging itself by aborting a dislocated print.</p>

	<p><strong>Diagnosing a Dislocation:</strong> 
		<ul>
			<li>Look for any warping, curling, or lifting of your part from the print bed.</li>
			<li>Look for unexpected clumps or bulges of material in your part.</li>
			<li>Check to see if your belts or pulleys are loose; for more information, see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208282283">Adjusting the Belt Tension</a>.</p></li>
			<li>If you are using supports, see if they buckled or dislodged from the part at any point.</li>
		</ul>
	<br />
	<p><strong>Reasons for Dislocations:</strong> 
		<ul>
			<li>Warping, curling, or lifting likely indicates that your print bed was not sufficiently glued or that your part was exposed to cool air while printing.</li>
			<li>If your part is dense, warping or curling can indicate that your nylon is wet.</li>
			<li>A clump of material generally means that the nozzles are too close to the print bed and do not allow enough room for extruding materials.</li>
			<li>Failing supports can happen if the span you are trying to support is too tall or long. Failing supports can also occur if the nozzle is too far from the print bed.</li>
		</ul>

	<p><strong>Solutions for Dislocations:</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>Clean and level your print bed.<br />
				<em>See <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208157283">Preparing the Print Bed</a> and <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896386">Level the Print Bed</a> for more information.</em></li>
			<li>Always keep your nylon in a sealed drybox. If you suspect your nylon is wet, run the Nylon Calibration Test.<br />
				<em>See <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207985456">Nylon Calibration Extrude Test</a> for more information.</em></li>
			<li>If your supports are failing, try changing the support angle in Eiger or reorienting your part so the supports are not as long or high.<br />
				<em>See <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207951316">Orient Parts for Printing</a> for more information.</em></li>
			<li>Use the Brim feature.</li>
