	<p>All printers jam from time to time. When possible, clear fiber jams by pulling fiber out from the tip nozzle in the direction the fiber flows during printing. If the fiber is no longer sticking out of the nozzle, a jam in the fiber bowden tube can be cleared by loosening the bunched fiber with a heat gun, while pulling the fiber.</p>
	<p><strong>To clear a jam in the Fiber Bowden Tube:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<!-- Step 1 -->
			<li>Select <strong>"Utilities"</strong> then <strong>"Temperature Control"</strong> from the menu in the upper right corner of the LCD screen on your printer.</li>
			<!-- Step 2 -->
			<li>Follow the on-screen prompt to heat up both nozzles on your printer. This may take a few minutes.</li>
			<!-- Step 3 -->
			<li>When the nozzles are up to temperature, loosen the fiber thumb screw and remove the Fiber Bowden Tube from the print head.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201516979/MF_Clogged_Fiber_Boden.JPG" alt="" width="702" height="525" /><br /><br /></li>
			<!-- Step 4 -->
			<li>Use a heat gun to heat up the part of the Bowden Tube that is jammed. For best results, place the heat gun on a solid surface and make sure the heat does not exceed 260 degrees Celcius.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201595945/Heat_Gun_Fiber_Boden.JPG" alt="" width="702" height="525" /><br /><br /></li>
			<!-- Step 5 -->
			<li>After about 10 seconds of applying heat to the tube, try to pull the loose end of the fiber. If the fiber does not come out, apply heat for 10 more seconds and try again.</li>
			<!-- Step 6 -->
			<li>Once the fiber is removed, you can re-install the Fiber Bowden Tube and reload fiber into your printer. Be careful to avoid touching any components that may have heated up during the process.</li>
