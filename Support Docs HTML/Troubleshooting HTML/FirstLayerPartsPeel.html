<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Parts Peeling off Print Bed</strong></span></p>
	<p>If you are experiencing parts that peel up off of the print bed during printing, there are several factors that may be contributing to the issue. Peeling parts can lead to dislocation errors or damage to your printer.</p>
	<p><strong>If your part is peeling off the bed, try the following tasks and solutions:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Check the bed levelness and print the bed level test part. <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> If your bed is too high or is not level, parts will not extrude properly and may peel. The first layer of your part should have a height of 0.1mm. <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Level the print bed again and reprint the test part. Make sure the first layer of your test part has a height of 0.1mm. If the height is less than 0.1mm, you will have to level the bed again with less pressure on the shims.</strong></span><br /><br /></li>

			<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Check the part under the microscope. Look to see if the lines of extruded nylon are touching at the sides. <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> When nylon is wet it will generally underextrude. This results in each string of nylon being too thin and keeps the layers from bonding together or to the print bed.  <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Keep your nylon in a dry box at all times. Purge your printer of the nylon that is currently in the Bowden tube. If the nylon is still underextruding, you may need to replace the entire spool.</strong></span><br /><br /></li>

			<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Check that there is glue under the entire base of the part. <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> The glue is what keeps the first layer secured to the print bed. Not having glue under the corners or edges of the part will likely result in peeling or warping.  <br />
			<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Remove the failed part, clean your print bed, and reglue your print bed. Wait for the glue to be dry to the touch and rerun the print. </strong></span><br /><br /></li>

		</ol>
		<p><strong>Other Strategies</strong> - If the above all fail, this problem may also be solved by adding fiber to a few layers at the bottom of your part, or by printing only one part at a time.</p>
