<!-- USB Drive -->
<p id="usb"> </p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What is the USB drive for?</strong></span></p>
	<p>The included USB key is a factory backup of your Mark Two's software. Should you have any debilitating software or printing issues, this drive will help you restore your Mark Two to factory settings.</p>
	<p>For more information about resetting your Mark Two, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208011716">Mark Two System Reset</a>.</p>
	<p><em>Note: Do not discard or overwite the provided USB key. Do not use the provided USB key for installing system updates.</em></p>

<!-- Glue Stick -->
<p id="glue"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What is the glue stick for?</strong></span></p>
	<p>The provided glue stick helps with part adhesion to the print bed and MUST be used on every print.</p>
	<p>For more information about proper use of the glue stick or setting up your print bed, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208157283">Preparing the Print Bed</a>.</p>

<!-- Help in Eiger -->
<p id="eiger"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>How can I get help in Eiger</strong></span></p>
	<p>There are two main ways to get help in Eiger:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If you are having an issue slicing a part or if you need to share your Eiger Solid at any time, use the <strong>"Get Support"</strong> button in Eiger's main viewer window.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204477903/GetSupport.PNG" alt="" width="150px" /><br /><br /></li>
			<li>If you simply want to view support articles or submit a ticket, you can select <strong>"Support"</strong> from the menu in the upper right corner of your Eiger window.<br /><br /><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204477923/Support.png" alt="" width="250px" /><br /><br /></li>
		</ol>

<!-- Printer Disabled -->
<p id="message"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What do I do if I get "Printer Disabled" messages?</strong></span></p>
	<p>If your printer fails during a print and the home screen shows "Printer Disabled," please save your logs to USB and file a support ticket with your logs attached to the ticket.</p>
	<p>For more information about saving logs, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208342663">Save Logs to USB</a>.</p>

<!-- Extruder Clicks -->
<p id="extruder"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why does the extruder click when loading plastic?</strong></span></p>
	<p>The load Nylon routine is at a speed greater than the steady state extrude capabilities of the print head and faster than you'll ever print.  The extruder is current limited to "skip" the motor steps before it strips the feed material.  The fact that it still feeds line instead of grinding your line to dust and clogging is one of the features we have over other desktop printers.</p>
	<p>If your extruder is skipping and no material is being extruded, please contact Support.</p>

<!-- Weak/Delaminated Parts -->
<p id="weak"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What do I do about weak or delaminated parts?</strong></span></p>
	<p>Low plastic extrusion can cause weak interlayer strength in the parts.  In the case of these printed parts below, the extrusion was 40% low (by weight).  The parts delaminate when bent, and show poor interlayer adhesion. </p>
	<p>For more information about diagnosing and fixing issues related to low plastic extrusion, please see the <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207985456"">Nylon Calibration Extrude Test</a> page.</p>

<!-- First Layer is Opaque -->
<p id="opaque"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What do I do if the first layer of a part is opaque?</strong></span></p>
	<p>This is most likely caused by the bed not being level.  Check the bed levelness and re-run the Bed Level Routine if necessary.</p>
	<p>For more information, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896386">Level the Print Bed</a>.</p>

<!-- Fiber doesn't adhere -->
<p id="fiber"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why doesn't fiber adhere well in my part?</strong></span></p>
	<p>There are a few checks you can do to determine why the fiber is not adhering:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Ensure that the plastic loaded in the machine is MarkForged nylon.</li>
			<li>Ensure that the proper fiber type is selected for the print. Different fiber materials have different print settings.</li>
			<li>If the fiber is still not adhering well, or does not look like it is properly filling on the first layers, re-level the bed to ensure that the fiber nozzle height is correct.<br />
			<em>Note: For more information, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896386">Level the Print Bed</a>.</em></li>
		</ol>

<!-- Nylon looks smeared -->
<p id="nylon"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Why does the first layer of nylon in my part look smeared?</strong></span></p>
	<p>If the first layers of your plastic print look smeared your fiber nozzle may be too low. Try to re-level the bed to ensure that the fiber nozzle height is correct.</p>
	<p>For more information, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896386">Level the Print Bed</a>.</p>
	<p>If you are printing plastic only, you can raise the height of your fiber nozzle above the print. Be sure to reset your fiber nozzle height before printing fiber again.</p>

<!-- What is the cylinder -->
<p id="cylinder"><a href=#top>Back To Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>What is this cylinder?</strong></span></p>
	<p>The plastic cylinder that prints the rear left-hand corner of the print bed is a purging routine that records the thermoplastic layer history. We call it a reference part - it is only produced when both nozzles are used (during a fiber print). Like the rings of a tree, this cylinder represents the layer history and thermoplastic history of your part.</p>
