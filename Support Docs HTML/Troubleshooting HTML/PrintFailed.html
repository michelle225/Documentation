	<p>Occasionally your prints may fail. Don't panic! If your printer is catastrophically out of order, <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">Contact Support</a>. Otherwise, here's what to do:</p>
	<ol>
		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Remove the part and thoroughly rinse your bed. <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> If your print bed has not been cleaned in a while, it may have a buildup of glue or risidual plastic in places. An unclean print bed prevents the base of the part from being level and creates a weak foundation for the rest of the part. <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Clean and prepare the print bed again. Be sure to level the print bed before applying glue for your part as the glue may cause an uneven bed.</strong></span><br />
		<em>Note: For more information about cleaning or preparing the print bed, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/208157283">Preparing the Print Bed</a>.</em><br /><br />
		
		</li>
		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Run the <strong>"Calibration Extrude Test"</strong> from the <strong>"Utilities"</strong> menu at least three times.<br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> If you hear the extruder clicking or plastic weight is low all three times, you are likely underextruding plastic. This is often cause wet nylon which will make your part print with strings or lumps. <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Replace your nylon and rerun the test. If new nylon does not fix the print, replace the plastic nozzle.</strong><br /></span>
		<em>Note: For additional information, please see <a href="https://www.eiger.io/settings/about">Loading Nylon Filament</a> and <a href="https://www.eiger.io/settings/about">Nylon Nozzle Replacement</a>.</em><br /><br />
	
		</li>
		<!-- Step 3 -->
		<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> If you are printing fiber, run the <strong>"Load Fiber"</strong> routine from the<strong>"Load/Unload"</strong> menu on your printer. Ensure that the fiber comes out of the nozzle in a single strand and that the Fiber Bowden Tube is clear of stray fiber pieces. <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> If fiber feeds all the way through the Fiber Bowden Tube but does not come out of the nozzle, you have a jam in either the tube or the nozzle. <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Try clearing the fiber tube and rerun the routine. If you still cannot load fiber through the nozzle, replace your nozzle.</strong><br /></span>
		<em>Note: For more information, please see <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/201567329-No-Fiber-Coming-From-Nozzle" target="_blank">No Fiber Coming From Nozzle</a> and <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/202170065-CFF-Fiber-Nozzle-Replacement" target="_blank">Fiber Nozzle Replacement</a>.</em><br /><br />
		
		</li>
		<!-- Step 4 -->
		<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> Run the <strong>"Level Print Bed"</strong> routine from the menu in the upper right corner of your printer's touch screen.  <br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> Unleveled bed and incorrect fiber nozzle height are the two leading causes of print failures.<br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Be sure to go all the way through the routine to adjust both nozzle heights properly. Take your time doing this so that the bed is as level as possible.<br /></strong></span>
		<em>Note: For more information, please see <a href="https://support.markforged.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896386">Level the Print Bed</a>.</em><br /><br />
		
		</li>
		<!-- Step 5 -->
		<li><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Task:</strong></span> If your part has any overhangs or if your part uses fiber, make sure to double check your print settings.<br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Reason for Failure:</strong></span> Forgetting to turn on supports or selecting the wrong type of fiber will cause a print to fail. Printing without supports, if they are needed, will cause the printer to print over thin air and will result in features not printing correctly. Printing with the wrong type of fiber will result in failure because each type of fiber has different specifications for printing; Eiger will only give your printer the specifications for the selected type of plastic.<br />
		<span class="wysiwyg-color-red110"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Solution:</span> Make sure Supports are ON, if needed. Make sure the same type of fiber is selected as is in your printer. <br /></strong></span>
