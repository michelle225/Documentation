<h1>Dislocations</h1>
<p>Dislocations occur when the printhead collides with either the part or the printer causing the stepper motors to skip. This occasionally happens when a print is going poorly. If the print <strong>curls </strong>or <strong>warps </strong>such that the printhead or nozzles collide with it then it will likely lead to a dislocation. <br /><br />Dislocations are unrecoverable. The Mark One is capable of detecting dislocations and will stop itself from wasting material or potentially damaging itself by aborting a dislocated print.</p>

<p>When the printer is printing the first layer, if either nozzle is too close to the print bed it tends to plow material out of the way. The plowed material builds up in random locations and if the ‘clump’ of material is large enough it can cause a dislocation when the print head hits it on its next pass.  The best way to prevent this is to level the bed prior to printing and make sure the nozzles are not too close.</p>
<p>When printing a very dense part, particularly with nylon that has started to take on moisture, sometimes the corners curl up as the plastic cools. The print head can hit these curled up corners if they protrude high enough.  The best way to prevent this is to make sure the bed is properly glued before each print and keep the nylon dry.</p>
<p>When printing parts with substantial supports, sometimes a support comes loose and obstructs the print head's motion.  This is most often caused by the plastic nozzle being too far away from the print bed.  Also, the longer the support, the more sensitivity to this failure.  To prevent this, ensure that the nozzle height is correct by proper bed leveling.  Also, rotating the support angle so that the supports are as short as possible is a good strategy.</p>
